The Causality in Cognition Lab (CICL) is seeking undergraduate research assistants to help us in our investigation of causal cognition! The CICL is a cognitive psychology lab headed by Tobias Gerstenberg. We use a combination of empirical and computational methods to understand how humans reason about cause and effect in the world.

For the fall quarter, research assistants will focus on helping with our causal eyetracking projects. Recent work led by Prof. Gerstenberg has shown that eye movements give us insight into how people make causal judgements. Research assistants will help expand this line of study by recruiting participants and running experiments in this paradigm. RAs will also join for our weekly lab meetings, where we discuss causality more generally and think about its relationship to other topics in cognitive science.

__Responsibilities and Relevant Skills__: As stated above, the primary responsibilities for the position are recruiting participants, running experiments, and attending lab meetings. Prior experience with psychological research, running experiments, and/or basic programming is helpful but not required. This is an opportunity to learn about all three!

__Time Commitment__: RAs are expected to commit 9 hours a week.

__Compensation__: Research assistants can be hired for course credit (PSYCH 195) or federal work-study (for those eligible). One unit of course credit is equivalent to 3 hours of work per week.

__To Apply__: Please send an email with a brief statement of interest to abeller@stanford.edu. Feel free to send any questions or concerns to the same address!
