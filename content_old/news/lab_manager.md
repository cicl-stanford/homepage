The Department of Psychology is looking for a full-time Social Science Research Coordinator. This is a one year fixed term position with strong possibility of renewal.

The [Causality in Cognition Lab (CICL)](http://cicl.stanford.edu/) studies how the mind learns to represent the causal structure of the world, and how we use this knowledge to predict what will happen, explain what happened, and hold others responsible for the consequences of their actions. In our research, we formalize people's mental models as computational models that yield quantitative predictions about a wide range of situations. To test these predictions, we use a combination of large-scale online experiments, interactive experiments in the lab, and eye-tracking experiments.

The Research Coordinator will help with various aspects of creating and maintaining the lab: keeping the lab homepage and lab wiki up to date, create templates for running online experiments, submitting and renewing IRB protocols, purchasing and maintaining research equipment and supplies, recruiting, training, and supervising undergraduate research assistants, collecting, managing, and analyzing data, running eye-tracking experiments, preparing conference presentations and manuscripts, managing lab calendars and schedules, and reading relevant literature. The position will allow authorship on research presentations and articles.
