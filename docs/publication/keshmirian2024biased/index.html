  <meta name="description" content="Causal reasoning is a critical aspect of both human cognition and artificial intelligence (AI), playing a prominent role in understanding the relationships between events.

In these structures, once the intermediate variable (B) is known, the probability of the outcome (C) is normatively independent of the initial cause (A).

Our findings show that, particularly with higher temperatures (i.e., greater randomness), LLMs exhibit a similar boost in the perceived causal power of Chains, suggesting the bias is at least partly reflected in language use.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">Causal reasoning is a critical aspect of both human cognition and artificial intelligence (AI), playing a prominent role in understanding the relationships between events. Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs) have been instrumental in modeling such relationships, using directed, acyclic links between nodes in a network to depict probabilistic associations between variables. Deviations from these graphical models&rsquo; edicts would result in biased judgments. This study explores one such bias in the causal judgments of humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) by examining two structures in CBNs: Canonical Chain (A→B→C) and Common Cause (A←B→C) networks. In these structures, once the intermediate variable (B) is known, the probability of the outcome &copy; is normatively independent of the initial cause (A).
