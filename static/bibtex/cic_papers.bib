	Abstract = {When do people say that an event that didn't happen was a cause? We extend the counterfactual simulation model (CSM) of causal judgment and test it in a series of three experiments that look at people's causal judgments about omissions in dynamic physical interactions. The problem of omissive causation highlights a series of sub-problems that need to be addressed in order to give an adequate causal explanation of why something happened: what are the relevant variables, what are their possible values, how are putative causal relationships evaluated, and how is the causal responsibility for an outcome attributed to multiple causes? The CSM predicts that people make causal judgments about omissions by mentally simulating what would have happened in relevant counterfactual situations. People use their intuitive understanding of physics to run these mental simulations. While prior work has argued that normative expectations affect judgments of omissive causation, we suggest a concrete mechanism of how this happens: expectations affect what counterfactuals people consider, and the more certain people are that the counterfactual outcome would have been different from what actually happened, the more causal they judge the omission to be. Our experiments show that both the structure of the physical situation as well as expectations about what will happen affect people's judgments.},

	Abstract = {To evaluate others' actions, we consider action outcomes (e.g., positive or negative) and the actors' underlying intentions (e.g., intentional or accidental). However, we often encounter situ- ations where neither actual outcomes nor intentions provide useful evidence for evaluation but representations of unreal- ized (counterfactual) outcomes matter. Here we ask whether preschool-aged children consider counterfactual outcomes to evaluate whose action was more helpful. When two agents each caught one of two falling apples (one caught it above a trash can and the other above a fruit basket), children chose the former as the one who should be thanked (because otherwise the apple would've fallen into the trash). When the agents caught crushed cans, however, children made the op- posite choice, choosing the agent who caught the can over the fruit basket. Even though preschoolers typically struggle with counterfactuals, children in our task readily engaged in such reasoning in the context of social evaluation.},

@article{grinfeld2020robust,
	Abstract = {How do people judge the degree of causal responsibility that an agent has for the outcomes of her actions? We show that a relatively unexplored factor -- the robustness (or stability) of the causal chain linking the agent's action and the outcome -- influences judgments of causal responsibility of the agent. In three experiments, we vary robustness by manipulating the number of background circumstances under which the action causes the effect, and find that causal responsibility judgments increase with robustness. In the first experiment, the robustness manipulation also raises the probability of the effect given the action. Experiments 2 and 3 control for probability-raising, and show that robustness still affects judgments of causal responsibility. In particular, Experiment 3 introduces an Ellsberg type of scenario to manipulate robustness, while keeping the conditional probability and the skill deployed in the action fixed. Experiment 4, replicates the results of Experiment 3, while contrasting between judgments of causal strength and of causal responsibility. The results show that in all cases, the perceived degree of responsibility (but not of causal strength) increases with the robustness of the action-outcome causal chain.},

@article{kominsky2020trajectory,
	Abstract = {Young children often struggle to answer the question 'what would have happened?', particularly in cases where the adult-like `correct' answer has the same outcome as the events that actually occurred. Previous work has assumed that children fail because they cannot engage in accurate counter- factual simulations. Children have trouble considering what to change and what to keep fixed when comparing counterfactual alternatives to reality. However, most studies of the development of counterfactual reasoning have relied on binary yes/no responses to counterfactual questions about complex narratives, and so have only been able to document when these failures occur but not why and how. Here, we investigate counterfactual reasoning in a domain where specific counterfactual possibilities are very concrete: Simple physical interactions. In Experiment 1, we show that 5-10-year-old children struggle to answer binary counterfactual questions in this domain, but succeed in making predictions. In Experiment 2, we use a multiple-choice method to allow children to select a specific counterfactual possibility. We find that 4-6-year-old children do conduct counterfactual simulations, but the counterfactual possibilities younger children consider differ from adult- like reasoning in systematic ways: Children allow one additional part of the scenario they watched to vary. Experiment 3 provides further evidence that young children engage in simulation rather than using a simpler visual matching strategy. Together, these experiments show that the developmental changes in counterfactual reasoning are not simply a matter of whether children can engage in counterfactual simulation, but also how they do so.},

@article{niemi2020moral,
	Abstract = {Prior work has found that moral values that build and bind groups - that is, the binding values of ingroup loyalty, respect for authority, and preservation of purity\textemdash are linked to blaming people who have been harmed. The present research investigated whether people's endorsement of binding values predicts their assignment of the causal locus of harmful events to the victims of the events. We used an implicit causality task from psycholinguistics in which participants read a sentence in the form 'SUBJECT verbed OBJECT because. . .' where male and female proper names occupy the SUBJECT and OBJECT position. The participants were asked to predict the pronoun that follows 'because' - the referent to the subject or object - which indicates their intuition about the likely cause of the event. We also collected explicit judgments of causal contributions and measured participants' moral values to investigate the relationship between moral values and the causal interpretation of events. Using two verb sets and two independent replications (N = 459, 249, 788), we found that greater endorsement of binding values was associated with a higher likelihood of selecting the object as the cause for harmful events in the implicit causality task, a result consistent with, and supportive of, previous moral psychological work on victim blaming. Endorsement of binding values also predicted explicit causal attributions to victims. Overall, these findings indicate that moral values that support the group rather than the individual reliably predict that people shift the causal locus of harmful events to those affected by the harms.},

@article{kirfel2020inference,
	Abstract = {What do we learn from a causal explanation? Upon being told that "The fire occurred because a lit match was dropped", we learn that both of these events occurred, and that there is a causal relationship between them. However, causal explanations of the kind "E because C" typically disclose much more than what is explicitly stated. Here, we offer a communication-theoretic account of causal explanations and show specifically that explanations can provide information about the extent to which a cited cause is normal or abnormal, and about the causal structure of the situation. In Experiment 1, we demonstrate that people infer the normality of a cause from an explanation when they know the underlying causal structure. In Experiment 2, we show that people infer the causal structure from an explanation if they know the normality of the cited cause. We find these patterns both for scenarios that manipulate the statistical and prescriptive normality of events. Finally, we consider how the communicative function of explanations, as highlighted in this series of experiments, may help to elucidate the distinctive roles that normality and causal structure play in causal explanation.},

@article{gerstenberg2020csm,
	Abstract = {How do people make causal judgments? We propose the counterfactual simulation model (CSM) of causal judgment which predicts causal judgments by comparing what actually happened with counterfactual simulations of what would have happened in relevant contingencies. It postulates different aspects of causation that capture whether the cause made a difference to whether and how the outcome occurred, and if the cause was sufficient and robust. We test the CSM in three experiments that ask participants to make judgments about dynamic collision events. Experiment 1 reveals a very close quantitative mapping between causal judgments, and participants' belief that the outcome would have been different without the cause. Experiment 2 demonstrates that counterfactual contrasts are necessary for explaining causal judgments. Participants' judgments differ dramatically between pairs of situations in which what actually happened was identical, but what would have happened differed. Experiment 3 features two candidate causes and shows that participants' judgments are sensitive to different aspects of causation. The CSM provides a better fit to participants' judgments than a heuristic model which uses features based on what actually happened. We discuss how the CSM can be used to model the semantics of different causal verbs, deal with causation by omission, and be extended beyond the physical domain.},

@article{langenhoff2019voting,
	Abstract = {How do people hold others responsible for their actions? In this paper, we test and extend a computational framework originally introduced by Gerstenberg et al. (2018) that assigns responsibility as a function of two factors: a dispositional inference that captures what we learn about a person's character from their action, and the causal role that the person's action played in bringing about the outcome. This framework has been shown to accurately capture how people assign responsibility to decision-makers in achievement contexts. Here, we focus on a more complex group setting in which political committee members vote on whether or not a policy should be passed. This setting allowed us to manipulate both dispositional inferences and causal attributions in graded ways, as well as directly test the model's key components by asking participants to judge how surprising and how important a committee member's vote was. Participants' answers to these questions in Experiment 1 accurately predicted the responsibility judgments of another group of participants in Experiment 2. In Experiment 3, we show that the model also predicts moral responsibility judgments and that, in the moral domain, dispositional inferences affect responsibility judgments more strongly than causal attributions.},

@article{gerstenberg2019physical,
	Abstract = {When several causes contributed to an outcome, we often single out one as ``the'' cause. What explains this selection? Previous work has argued that people select abnormal events as causes, though recent work shows that sometimes normal events are preferred over abnormal ones. Existing studies have relied on vignettes that commonly feature agents committing immoral acts. An important challenge to the thesis that norms permeate causal reasoning is that people's responses may merely reflect pragmatic or social reasoning rather than arising from causal cognition per se. We test this hypothesis by asking whether the previously observed patterns of causal selection emerge in tasks that recruit participants' causal reasoning about physical systems. Strikingly, we find that the same patterns observed in vignette studies with intentional agents arises in visual animations of physical interactions. Our results demonstrate how deeply normative expectations affect causal cognition.},

We trace how causal inference tools developed in data science have been applied to understanding human causal learning and reasoning, highlight the current shortcomings of both intervention-based and time-based approaches taken separately, and describe recent work that starts to bring the two together. We end by sketching an account of interventional and temporal evidence as constituents of a unified online causal learning process.},

@article{morris2019quantitative,
	Abstract = {When many events contributed to an outcome, people consistently judge some more causal than others, based in part on the prior probabilities of those events. For instance, when a tree bursts into flames, people judge the lightning strike more of a cause than the presence of oxygen in the air---in part because oxygen is so common, and lightning strikes are so rare. These effects, which play a major role in several prominent theories of token causation, have largely been studied through qualitative manipulations of the prior probabilities. Yet, there is good reason to think that people's causal judgments are on a continuum---and relatively little is known about how these judgments vary quantitatively as the prior probabilities change. In this paper, we measure people's causal judgment across parametric manipulations of the prior probabilities of antecedent events. Our experiments replicate previous qualitative findings, and also reveal several novel patterns that are not well-described by existing theories.

@article{yildirim2019difficulty,
	Abstract = {How do we estimate the difficulty of performing a new task, a task we've never tried before such as making a sculpture, a birthday cake, or building a tower with LEGO blocks? Estimating difficulty helps us appreciate others' accomplishments, and plays a critical role in deciding whether to undertake new tasks ourselves. Here we give a computational account of how humans judge the difficulty of a range of physical construction tasks, whererby the goal is to go from an inital configuration (e.g. blocks scattered on the floor) to a target configuration (e.g. a block tower). Our model takes into account two key aspects that influence construction difficulty: physical effort and physical risk. Physical effort captures the minimal raw work needed to  transport all objects to their final positions and is computed using a hybrid task-and-motion planner. Physical risk corresponds to the precision with which objects must be transported for success, and is computed using noisy physics simulations; it reflects the costs (e.g., attention, coordination and fine motor movements) needed to ensure precise motion. We show that the full effort-risk model captures human estimates of difficulty and construction time better than either component alone, and that difficulty judgments are selectively sensitive to effort and risk in a task-dependent manner.},

	Abstract = {When holding others morally responsible, we care about what they did and what they thought. Traditionally, research in moral psychology has relied on vignette studies, in which the protagonist's actions and thoughts are explicitly communicated. Recent studies have begun to employ visual stimuli, and some have postulated a direct link from processing visual features to making moral judgments. We embrace the advent of visual stimuli in moral psychology, but believe that the connection between visual processing and moral judgments is mediated by an inference about what the observed action reveals about the agent's mental states. We formalize moral judgments as computations over an intuitive theory of physics combined with an intuitive theory of mind. Knowing that mental states lead to action (e.g., the belief that someone is in harm's way and the desire to help them stimulates a decision to shove them out of harm's way), and that these actions are constrained by physics (the shove has to be forceful enough, aimed in the right direction, timed appropriately, etc.), allows an observer to make powerful inferences about moral responsibility. Two experiments show that this model captures moral judgments about physical scenes, both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

@article{bramley2018experiments,
	Abstract = {Many aspects of our physical environment are hidden. For example, it is hard to estimate how heavy an object is from visual observation alone. In this paper we examine how people actively "experiment" within the physical world to discover such latent properties. In the first part of the paper, we develop a novel framework for the quantitative analysis of the information produced by physical interactions. We then describe two experiments that present participants with moving objects in "microworlds" that operate according to continuous spatiotemporal dynamics similar to everyday physics (i.e., forces of gravity, friction, etc ...). Participants were asked to interact with objects in the microworlds in order to identify their masses, or the forces of attraction/repulsion that governed their movement. Using our modeling framework, we find that learners who freely interacted with the physical system selectively produced evidence that revealed the physical property consistent with their inquiry goal. As a result, their inferences were more accurate than for passive observers and, in some contexts, for yoked participants who watched video replays of an active learner's interactions. We characterize active learners' actions into a range of micro-experiment strategies and discuss how these might be learned or generalized from past experience. The technical contribution of this work is the development of a novel analytic framework and methodology for the study of interactively learning about the physical world. Its empirical contribution is the demonstration of sophisticated goal directed human active learning in a naturalistic context.},

	Abstract = {How do people hold others responsible for the consequences of their actions? We propose a computational model that attributes responsibility as a function of what the observed action reveals about the person, and the causal role that the person's action played in bringing about the outcome. The model first infers what type of person someone is from having observed their action. It then compares a prior expectation of how a person would behave with a posterior expectation after having observed the person's action. The model predicts that a person is blamed for negative outcomes to the extent that the posterior expectation is lower than the prior, and credited for positive outcomes if the posterior is greater than the prior. We model the causal role of a person's action by using a counterfactual model that considers how close the action was to having been pivotal for the outcome. The model captures participants' responsibility judgments to a high degree of quantitative accuracy across three experiments that cover a range of different situations. It also solves an existing puzzle in the literature on the relationship between action expectations and responsibility judgments. Whether an unexpected action yields more or less credit depends on whether the action was diagnostic for good or bad future performance.},

Here we assess whether children can go further and appreciate performance in context: The same pattern of performance can contribute to a team outcome in different ways, depending on the underlying rule framework. Two experiments, with three age groups (4/5-year-olds, 6/7-year-olds, and adults), varied performance of team members, with the same performance patterns considered under three different game rules for winning or losing. These three rules created distinct underlying causal structures (additive, conjunctive, disjunctive), for how individual performance affected the overall team outcome. Even the youngest children differentiated between different game rules in their reward allocations. Rather than only rewarding individual performance, or whether the team won/lost, children were sensitive to the team structure and how players' performance contributed to the win/loss under each of the three game rules. Not only do young children consider it fair to allocate resources based on merit, but they are also sensitive to the causal structure of the situation which dictates how individual contributions combine to determine the team outcome.},

	Abstract = {When many things contribute to an outcome, people consistently judge certain ones to be the outcome's ``actual'' cause. For instance, people believe the lit match, not the surrounding oxygen, was the cause of the fire. Why? Here, we offer a functional account of actual causation: Repeatedly judging whether something (e.g. the match) was the actual cause of an outcome (e.g. the fire) helps compute the probability that introducing it would produce the outcome. In other words, judgments of actual causation accumulate evidence about the effectiveness of potential interventions. We offer a formal account of this process, and show how it explains three basic qualitative features of causal judgment: why actual causes tend (1) to be necessary, (2) to be abnormal (the ``abnormal selection'' effect), and (3) to lack abnormal counterparts (the ``supersession'' effect). We show that this approach -- which we call the ``Sample-based Approximation Method for Predicting the Likelihood of Effectiveness'', or the SAMPLE approach -- makes quantitative predictions that closely match participants' judgments in a novel experiment},

	Abstract = {Language that describes people in a concise manner may conflict with social norms (e.g., referring to people by their race), presenting a conflict between transferring information efficiently and avoiding offensive language. When a speaker is describing others, we propose that listeners consider the speaker's use or absence of potentially offensive language to reason about the speaker's goals. We formalize this hypothesis in a probabilistic model of polite pragmatic language understanding, and use it to generate predictions about interpretations of utterances in ambiguous contexts, which we test empirically. We find that participants are sensitive to potentially offensive language when resolving ambiguity in reference. These results support the idea that listeners represent conflicts in speakers' goals and use that uncertainty to interpret otherwise underspecified utterances.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a novel experimental paradigm for studying multi-modal integration in causal inference. Our experiments feature a physically realistic Plinko machine in which a ball is dropped through one of three holes and comes to rest at the bottom after colliding with a number of obstacles. We develop a hypothetical simulation model which postulates that people figure out what happened by integrating visual and auditory evidence through mental simulation. We test the model in a series of three experiments. In Experiment 1, participants only receive visual information and either predict where the ball will land, or infer in what hole it was dropped based on where it landed. In Experiment 2, participants receive both visual and auditory information -- they hear what sounds the dropped ball makes. We find that participants are capable of integrating both sources of information, and that the sounds help them figure out what happened. In Experiment 3, we show strong cue integration: even when vision and sound are individually completely non-diagnostic, participants succeed by combining both sources of evidence.},

Counterfactual theories of causal judgments predict that people compare what actually happened with what would have happened if the candidate cause had been absent. Process theories predict that people focus only on what actually happened, to assess the mechanism linking candidate cause and outcome. We tracked participants' eye movements while they judged whether one billiard ball caused another one to go through a gate or prevented it from going through. Both participants' looking patterns and their judgments demonstrated that counterfactual simulation played a critical role. Participants simulated where the target ball would have gone if the candidate cause had been removed from the scene. The more certain participants were that the outcome would have been different, the stronger the causal judgments. These results provide the first direct evidence for spontaneous counterfactual simulation in an important domain of high-level cognition.},

In this paper, we propose a counterfactual replacement model according to which people attribute responsibility by comparing their prior expectation about how an agent was going to act in a given situation, with their posterior expectation after having observed the agent's action. The model predicts blame if the posterior expectation is worse than the prior expectation and credit if it is better. In a novel experiment, we manipulate people's prior expectations by changing the framing of a structurally isomorphic task. As predicted by our counterfactual replacement model, people's prior expectations significantly influenced their responsibility attributions. We also show how our model can capture Johnson and Rips's (2013) findings that an agent is attributed less responsibility for bringing about a positive outcome when their action was suboptimal rather than optimal.},

This approach raises two questions: First, what structure do people use to represent a given situation? Second, how do they choose what alternatives to consider when intervening on an event? We use a series of coin-tossing scenarios to compare empirical data to different models within the proposed framework. The results suggest that people sample their intervention values from a prior rather than deterministically switching the value of a variable. The results further suggest that people represent scenarios differently when asked to reason about their own blame attributions, compared with the blame attributions they believe others will assign.},

In line with Spellman (Journal of Experimental Psychology: General 126: 323--348, 1997), who proposed that a person's perceived causal contribution varies with the degree to which it changes the probability of the eventual outcome, Experiment 1 showed that in a team challenge in which the players contribute sequentially, the last player's blame or credit is attenuated if the team's result has already been determined prior to her acting. Experiment 2 illustrated that this attenuation effect does not overgeneralize to situations in which the experienced order of events does not map onto the objective order of events; the level of the last person's performance is only discounted if that person knew that the result was already determined. Furthermore, Experiment 1 demonstrated that responsibility attributions remain sensitive to differences in performance, even if the outcome is already determined. We suggest a theoretical extension of Spellman's model, according to which participants' responsibility attributions are determined not only by whether a contribution made a difference in the actual situation, but also by whether it would have made a difference had things turned out somewhat differently.},

In contrast to previous work that has argued that prior expectations are neglected when judging the closeness of counterfactual worlds (Kahneman & Varey, 1990), we show in Experiment 3 that participants are more likely to say something almost happened when they did not expect it. Both prior expectations and causal distance influence judgments of ``almost''.

@article{gerstenberg2009allocation,
	Abstract = {How do people assign responsibility to an individual cause or person in a situation of collective responsibility? This dissertation addresses the question by designing an experimental game, the Triangle Game (TG), which participants play in a group with three computer players. The participants' task is to count triangles presented in complex diagrams for a brief period of time. Whether the group wins or loses depends on the accuracy of each player in the group. After each round, participants assign responsibility for the result to each player. Three experimental conditions differ in how the individual judgments are combined to determine the deviation of the group's answer from the correct solution. This deviation determines whether a round is lost or won. For the three experimental conditions, the group's deviation is determined, respectively, by the sum of each player's deviation, the deviation of the least accurate player or the deviation of the most accurate player. The results show that these differences in the underlying causal structure have a significant influence on participants' responsibility ratings. Furthermore, the predictions of different cognitive models are tested. A model for assigning responsibility to individual causes in cases of multiple causation developed by Chockler and Halpern (2003) describes the empirical data best. A second experiment replicates these findings. In an additional step, participants were asked to change the result of each round, for example from a loss to a win, by minimally altering the answers that the players had given in that round. The results show that participants perceive a possible world, where several small changes have been made as more similar to the actual world than a possible world with one big change. The implications of these findings for counterfactual theories of causation are discussed. The main advantage of the TG is that it allows testing psychological theories of responsibility attribution in a formally rigorous manner.},

A wealth of evidence indicates that we often act habitually---a form of behavioral control that depends not on rational planning, but rather on a history of reinforcement.

@article{meder2010observing,
	Abstract = {Recently, a number of rational theories have been put forward which provide a coherent formal framework for modeling different types of causal inferences, such as prediction, diagnosis, and action planning. A hallmark of these theories is their capacity to simultaneously express probability distributions under observational and interventional scenarios, thereby rendering it possible to derive precise predictions about interventions (``doing'') from passive observations (``seeing''). In Part 1 of the paper we discuss different modeling approaches for formally representing interventions and review the empirical evidence on how humans draw causal inferences based on observations or interventions. We contrast deterministic interventions with imperfect actions yielding unreliable or unknown outcomes. In Part 2, we discuss alternative strategies for making interventional decisions when the causal structure is unknown to the agent. A Bayesian approach of rational causal inference, which aims to infer the structure and its parameters from the available data, provides the benchmark model. This account is contrasted with a heuristic approach which knows categories of causes and effects but neglects further structural information. The results of computer simulations show that despite its computational parsimony the heuristic approach achieves very good performance compared to the Bayesian model.},

Our model predicts that people arrive at their causal judgments by comparing what actually happened with what they think would have happened, had the collision between A and B not taken place. Participants' judgments about what would have happened are highly correlated with a noisy model of Newtonian physics. Using those counterfactual judgments, we can predict participants' cause and prevention judgments very accurately (r = .99).

We find an advantage for active learners over passive and yoked controls. Active participants spontaneously performed several kinds of ``natural experiments'' which reveal the objects' properties with varying success. While yoked participants' judgments were affected by the quality of the active participant they observed, they did not share the learning advantage, performing no better than passive controls overall. We discuss possible explanations for the divergence between active and yoked learners, and outline further steps to categorize and explore active learning in the wild.},

	Abstract = {Consider the following causal explanation: The ball went through the goal because the defender didn't block it. There are at least two problems with citing omissions as causal explanations. First, how do we choose the relevant candidate omission (e.g. why the defender and not the goalkeeper). Second, how do we determine what would have happened in the relevant counterfactual situation (i.e. maybe the shot would still have gone through the goal even if it had been blocked). In this paper, we extend the counterfactual simulation model (CSM) of causal judgment (Gerstenberg, Goodman, Lagnado, & Tenenbaum, 2014) to handle the second problem. In two experiments, we show how people's causal model of the situation affects their causal judgments via influencing what counterfactuals they consider. Omissions are considered causes to the extent that the outcome in the relevant counterfactual situation would have been different from what it actually was.},

@article{gerstenberg2013making,
	Abstract = {In this thesis, I develop a general framework of how people attribute responsibility. In this framework, people's responsibility attributions are modelled in terms of counterfactuals defined over a causal representation of the situation. A person is predicted to be held responsible to the extent that their action made a difference to the outcome. Accordingly, when attributing responsibility we compare what actually happened with the outcome in a simulated counterfactual world in which the person's action had been different. However, a person can still be held responsible for an outcome even if their action made no difference in the actual situation. Responsibility attributions are sensitive to whether a person's action would have made a difference in similar counterfactual situations. Generally, responsibility decreases with the number of events that would have needed to change from the actual situation in order to generate a counterfactual situation in which the person's action would have been pivotal. In addition to how close a person was to being pivotal, responsibility attributions are influenced by how critical a person's action was perceived prior to the outcome. The predictions derived from this general framework are tested in a series of experiments that manipulate a person's criticality and pivotality by varying the causal structure of the situation and the person's mental states. The results show that responsibility between the members of a group diffuses according to the causal structure which determines how individual contributions combine to yield a joint outcome. Differences in the group members' mental states, such as their knowledge about the situation, their expectations about each other's performance as well as their intentions, also affect attributions. Finally, I demonstrate how this general framework can be extended to model attributions for domains in which people have rich, intuitive theories that go beyond what can be expressed with simple causal models.},

	Abstract = {One of the hallmarks of human intelligence is its flexibility. While computers have achieved better-than-human performance in various games, such as Chess, Jeopardy, or Go, there is no single algorithm yet that works in all of these cases. Humans, however, can excel at all of these games, and many other tasks. We believe that bridging the gap between human and machine intelligence requires two key insights from cognitive science: (i) human knowledge is organized in terms of richly structured intuitive theories, and (ii) many cognitive processes can be understood as causal inferences operating over these structures. In this chapter, we first explain what intuitive theories are, how we can model them as probabilistic, generative programs, and how intuitive theories support various cognitive functions such as prediction, counterfactual reasoning, and explanation. We focus on two domains of knowledge: people's intuitive understanding of physics, and their intuitive understanding of psychology. We show how causal judgments can be modeled as counterfactual contrasts operating over an intuitive theory of physics, and how explanations of an agent's behavior are grounded in a rational planning model that is inverted to infer the agent's beliefs, desires, and abilities. We conclude by highlighting some of the challenges that the intuitive theories framework faces, such as understanding how intuitive theories are learned and developed.},

Participants decided whether to continue sentences like ``Amy killed Bob because...'' with either the pronoun he or she. We found that (1) implicit causality selections predicted explicit causal judgments, (2) selecting the object (victim) for harm/force events (e.g., kill, rape) predicted endorsement of moral values previously linked to victim-blame, and (3) higher hostile sexism predicted selecting the female as the cause in male-on-female harm/force.

The CSM predicts that people's causal judgments are influenced by whether a candidate cause made a difference to whether the outcome occurred as well as to how it occurred. We show how whethercausation and how-causation can be implemented in terms of different counterfactual contrasts defined over the same intuitive generative model of the domain. We test the model in an intuitive physics domain where people make judgments about colliding billiard balls. Experiment 1 shows that participants' counterfactual judgments about what would have happened if one of the balls had been removed, are well-explained by an approximately Newtonian model of physics. In Experiment 2, participants judged to what extent two balls were causally responsible for a third ball going through a gate or missing the gate. As predicted by the CSM, participants' judgments increased with their belief that a ball was a whether-cause, a how-cause, as well as sufficient for bringing about the outcome.},

We develop a general framework that builds on the notion of pivotality: an agent is pivotal if she could have changed the group outcome by acting differently. In three experiments we test successive refinements of this notion -- whether an agent is pivotal in close possible situations and the number of paths to achieve pivotality. In order to discriminate between potential models, we introduced group tasks with asymmetric structures. Some group members were complements (for the two to contribute to the group outcome it was necessary that both succeed) whereas others were substitutes (for the two to contribute to the group outcome it was sufficient that one succeeds). Across all three experiments we found that people's attributions were sensitive to the number of paths to pivotality. In particular, an agent incurred more blame for a team loss in the presence of a successful complementary peer than in the presence of a successful substitute.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge organizes our understanding of the world, determining what we expect given what we have already seen. Our predictive representations have two key properties: they are productive, and they are graded. Productive generalization is possible because our knowledge decomposes into concepts - elements of knowledge that are combined and recombined to describe particular situations. Gradedness is the observable effect of accounting for uncertainty - our knowledge encodes degrees of belief that lead to graded probabilistic predictions. To put this a different way, concepts form a combinatorial system that enables description of many different situations; each such situation specifies a distribution over what we expect to see in the world, given what we have seen. We may think of this system as a probabilistic language of thought (PLoT), in which representations are built from language-like composition of concepts, and the content of those representations is a probability distribution on world states. The purpose of this chapter is to formalize these ideas in computational terms, to illustrate key properties of the PLoT approach with a concrete example, and to draw connections with other views of conceptual structure.},

As a guiding framework it uses the causal model framework (Pearl, 2000) rooted in structural models and counterfactuals, and shows how it can resolve many of the problems that beset standard but-for analyses. It argues that legal concepts of causation are closely related to everyday causal reasoning, and both are tailored to the practical concerns of responsibility attribution. Causal models are also critical when people evaluate evidence, both in terms of the stories they tell to make sense of evidence, and the methods they use to assess its credibility and reliability.},

The prevalence of over-determination in such cases makes this a difficult problem for counterfactual theories of causal responsibility. In this article, we explore a general framework for assigning responsibility in multiple agent contexts. We draw on the structural model account of actual causation (e.g., Halpern & Pearl, 2005) and its extension to responsibility judgments (Chockler & Halpern, 2004). We review the main theoretical and empirical issues that arise from this literature and propose a novel model of intuitive judgments of responsibility. This model is a function of both pivotality (whether an agent made a difference to the outcome) and criticality (how important the agent is perceived to be for the outcome, before any actions are taken). The model explains empirical results from previous studies and is supported by a new experiment that manipulates both pivotality and criticality. We also discuss possible extensions of this model to deal with a broader range of causal situations. Overall, our approach emphasizes the close interrelations between causality, counterfactuals, and responsibility attributions.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the causes of human behavior is essential for advancing one's interests and for coordinating social relations. The scientific study of how people arrive at such understandings or explanations has unfolded in four distinguishable epochs in psychology, each characterized by a different metaphor that researchers have used to represent how people think as they attribute causality and blame to other individuals. The first epoch was guided by an _intuitive scientist_ metaphor, which emphasized whether observers perceived behavior to be caused by the unique tendencies of the actor or by common reactions to the requirements of the situation. This metaphor was displaced in the second epoch by an _intuitive lawyer_ depiction that focused on the need to hold people responsible for their misdeeds. The third epoch was dominated by theories of counterfactual thinking, which conveyed a _person as reconstructor_ approach that emphasized the antecedents and consequences of imagining alternatives to events, especially harmful ones. With the current upsurge in moral psychology, the fourth epoch emphasizes the moral-evaluative aspect of causal judgment, reflected in a _person as moralist_ metaphor. By tracing the progression from the person-environment distinction in early attribution theories to present concerns with moral judgment, our goal is to clarify how causal constructs have been used, how they relate to one another, and what unique attributional problems each addresses.},

	Abstract = {Would Dan have died if Bob hadn't shot? In this paper, we show that people's answer depends on whether or not they are asked about what would have caused Bob not to shoot. Something needs to change in order to turn an actual world into a counterfactual world. Previous findings of how people reason about counterfactuals have been mixed: sometimes people appear to backtrack and reevaluate the causes of a counterfactual state (e.g. Rips, 2010). At other times, people appear to treat counterfactuals like interventions that leave the past unchanged (Sloman & Lagnado, 2005). We experimentally manipulated the order in which participants were asked to consider the consequences of a counterfactual state. The results show that participants are more likely to backtrack when explicitly asked to consider a counterfactual's causes. However, when directly asked about the effects of a counterfactual state, most people don't backtrack.},

	Abstract = {How do people attribute responsibility to individuals in a group? Several models in psychology predict that there is a close relationship between counterfactuals and responsibility: how responsible an individual's contribution is seen depends on whether it made a difference to the outcome. We first review these models and then point out a major limitation: people sometimes hold individuals responsible even though their contribution made no relevant difference to the outcome. A richer conception of the relationship between counterfactuals and responsibility is necessary. People's attributions of responsibility are not only influenced by whether a person's contribution made a difference in the actual situation, but also by whether it would have made a difference in other possible situations. We propose a general framework that conceptualizes attributions of responsibility in terms of counterfactuals defined over structured causal models. Using this framework, we show that retrospective responsibility attributions are also affected by prospective responsibility. A person's responsibility depends on how critical their contribution was perceived for the group's success and on how close it was to making a difference to the outcome.},
