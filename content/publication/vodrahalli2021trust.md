abstract = "In many applications of AI, the algorithm's output is framed as a suggestion to a human user. The user may ignore the advice or take it into consideration to modify his/her decisions. With the increasing prevalence of such human-AI interactions, it is important to understand how users act (or do not act) upon AI advice, and how users regard advice differently if they believe the advice come from an ``AI'' versus another human. In this paper, we characterize how humans use AI suggestions relative to equivalent suggestions from a group of peer humans across several experimental settings. We find that participants' beliefs about the human versus AI performance on a given task affects whether or not they heed the advice. When participants decide to use the advice, they do so similarly for human and AI suggestions. These results provide insights into factors that affect human-AI interactions."
