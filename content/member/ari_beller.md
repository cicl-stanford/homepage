description = "I am interested in computational approaches to understanding cognition. I like to describe mental processes as computer programs because having a precise, formal language allows me to characterize subtle patterns of thought that are difficult to capture with words. I enjoy this field of study because it helps me better understand myself and the people around me. I like to drink water."
