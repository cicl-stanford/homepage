I'm the PI of the Causality in Cognition Lab (CiCL). You can see me in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlZkTfX9LEWADfOmHYhzn45KMLvtX-Zu4). 

## Research interests

Here are some of the things I'm interested in: 

- computational models of cognition
- causal inference 
- counterfactual reasoning
- mental simulation
- eye-tracking

You can find out more about what we do in the CiCL, what we value, and how to join us [here](../../research_values/). You can also take a look at my [research statement](../../misc/tobias_gerstenberg_research_statement.pdf).
