I'm the PI of Causality in Cognition lab (CICL). You can see me in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkbEIKQqoyA) at an invited symposium on causation at the Society for Philosophy and Psychology (SPP) conference. 

## Research interests 

Here are some keywords that capture what I'm interested in: 

- computational models of cognition
- causal inference 
- counterfactual reasoning
- mental simulation
- eye-tracking

If you'd like to learn more, you can take a look at my [research statement](../../misc/tobias_gerstenberg_research_statement.pdf).
